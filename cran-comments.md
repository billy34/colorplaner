## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. I have edited the description to remove the repetition 
of the package title.

## Test environments
* local Windows 10 install, R 3.3.1
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.1
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There is one NOTE for CRAN incoming feasibility:
* This is an initial submission for a new package.
* The spelling of the flagged words is as intended
    * bivariate (correct)
    * choropleth (correct)
    * ggplot (package title)

## Downstream dependencies
